# RBAC-UI
User Management Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Interface
This project presents a User Management System created using React-JS, offering an interface for managing users and roles. It includes features for adding, editing, and removing users and roles, all organized in a table layout. Each user has attributes like name, email, role, and status (active/inactive). The application utilizes localStorage to ensure data remains available even after refreshing the page.

Overview of the Project
This project focuses on building a frontend application for managing users, roles, and their associated permissions in a role-based system.
It equips administrators with tools to:

1.Efficiently view and assign roles and permissions to users.

2.Focus on responsive design, user-friendliness, and clear workflows for seamless role and permission handling.

Key Features:-

User Management: Perform actions like adding, editing, and removing users. Assign specific roles and update their status (Active/Inactive).

Role Management: Define or modify roles with permissions such as Read, Write, and Delete. Customize role attributes for flexibility.

Permission Control: Dynamically configure and assign permissions, with a clear visual display for easy understanding.

Mock API Simulation: Mimics API calls for user and role operations. Simulated responses provide a real-time experience.

Add, Edit, Delete Functions: Add new users, modify existing ones, and delete records with simple, intuitive controls.

Responsiveness: Designed for compatibility across desktop and mobile platforms, ensuring smooth interaction on any device.
Technologies Implemented:-

Frontend Framework: React

Styling: Tailwind CSS for modern and responsive designs

State Management: React hooks such as useState and useReducer

Mock API: Implemented using JSON or local JavaScript functions

LocalStorage Integration: User and role data persistence through the browser's localStorage

Setup and Installation:-
To use this project locally, follow the steps below:

Prerequisites:
Ensure Node.js and npm are installed.
Steps:
1.Clone the repository:
Copy code:-
git clone https://github.com/dubeyhars/RBAC-UI.git
2.
Install dependencies:

npm install
3.Run the application:

npm start
The app will launch in development mode. Access it in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

How It Works
Add Role:

Navigate to the Role Management section.
Click the Add Role button and define a role (e.g., Admin, Editor).
Assign appropriate permissions (Read, Write, Delete) and save the role.
Add User:

Open the User Management section.
Click Add User and fill out the form with the user's details.
Assign a role from the dropdown and set the userâ€™s status to Active or Inactive.
Save the user.
Edit and Delete:
Modify user details using the Edit button or remove users via the Delete option in the table.

LocalStorage Use:
All user and role data are stored in the browser's localStorage, allowing for persistence across sessions without needing a backend.

Usage
Manage Users: Add, modify, or delete user records.
Configure Roles: Define roles and assign specific permissions.
Adjust Permissions: Easily update role-based permissions through the interface.
